# hk

**Git hooks and project checks, in parallel.**

hk runs linters and formatters with read/write file locks, so independent work runs concurrently and tools that modify the same files take turns. Use the same steps in Git hooks, from your terminal, and in CI.

[Get started](https://hk.jdx.dev/getting_started) · [Documentation](https://hk.jdx.dev/) · [Built-in linters](https://hk.jdx.dev/builtins) · [CLI reference](https://hk.jdx.dev/cli/)

## Quick start

Install with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), then run these commands inside your repository:

```sh
mise use hk
hk init
hk install
hk check --all
```

`hk init` detects project tools and generates `hk.pkl`. Review the selected linters and make sure their executables are available on `PATH`; hk configures how to run them, but does not install them. Use `hk init --interactive` to choose tools yourself.

On Git 2.54+, you can run `hk install --global` once to enable hk across repositories. Installed hooks exit silently in projects without an hk configuration. See [installation options](https://hk.jdx.dev/getting_started#install-hooks) for older Git versions and mise environments.

You can also install hk with `brew install hk` or `cargo install hk --locked`. The default Pkl evaluator is built into hk; a separate Pkl installation is optional.

## A configuration you can share

This example uses hk’s built-in whitespace utilities, so it needs no additional linter:

```pkl
amends "package://github.com/jdx/hk/releases/download/v2.0.2/hk@2.0.2#/Config.pkl"
import "package://github.com/jdx/hk/releases/download/v2.0.2/hk@2.0.2#/Builtins.pkl"

steps {
  ["trailing-whitespace"] = Builtins.trailing_whitespace
  ["newlines"] = Builtins.newlines
}
```

Top-level `steps` is the recommended starting point: hk supplies `check`, `fix`, and `pre-commit` hooks using these steps. It is optional; you can also define steps only inside explicit hooks. See [hook defaults](https://hk.jdx.dev/configuration#hook-defaults).

Add tools such as `Builtins.prettier`, `Builtins.eslint`, or `Builtins.ruff`, or [define your own steps](https://hk.jdx.dev/reference/examples/custom-linters).

## Everyday commands

| Command                   | Use it to                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `hk check`                | Check modified files                                  |
| `hk fix`                  | Apply available fixes to modified files               |
| `hk check --all`          | Check the repository, including in CI                 |
| `hk check --plan`         | Preview selected files and steps without running them |
| `hk check --why prettier` | Explain why a step will run or be skipped             |

By convention, checks do not modify files. `hk fix` leaves fixes unstaged unless you pass `--stage`. The default pre-commit hook stashes unstaged work, fixes and stages changes, then restores the unstaged work. Review `git diff` and `git diff --cached`. [Learn about hooks and partial commits](https://hk.jdx.dev/hooks).

## Why hk?

- **Coordinate concurrent tools.** File locks protect overlapping steps; diff and file-list checks reduce the work that needs exclusive access.
- **Reuse linter configurations.** Builtins describe file patterns, check commands, fixes, and tool-specific optimizations.
- **Keep configuration maintainable.** Pkl provides types, imports, and reusable objects for sharing steps across hooks and projects.
- **Use your existing toolchain.** Run commands from `PATH`, or use [mise](https://hk.jdx.dev/mise_integration) to manage tools and environments.

## Agent skills

hk includes two skills for coding agents:

- [hk-configure](skills/hk-configure/SKILL.md): add linters and custom checks, preserve the project's
  Pkl schema version, and verify which files each step selects.
- [hk-debug](skills/hk-debug/SKILL.md): diagnose hook failures, skipped steps, configuration overrides,
  and partially staged files.

Both skills ship in the `skills/` directory of each release archive. hk's packslip manifest points
to those directories, so compatible installers can use the bundled instructions without a separate
repository download. Making them available to an agent is
opt-in; see [mise's skills documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-resources.html).
