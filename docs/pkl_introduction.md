description: Learn the Pkl syntax needed to configure hk, reuse steps, and diagnose evaluation errors.

# Pkl essentials

hk uses [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/) for typed configuration. Most projects need only a few features: amend the schema, import builtins, define steps, and reuse them across hooks.

Pkl evaluates configuration. hk then runs the commands that configuration defines.

## Start with the schema

Every project configuration should amend hk’s base schema:

```pkl
amends "package://github.com/jdx/hk/releases/download/v2.0.2/hk@2.0.2#/Config.pkl"
import "package://github.com/jdx/hk/releases/download/v2.0.2/hk@2.0.2#/Builtins.pkl"
```

`amends` supplies the allowed properties and classes, such as `Step`, `Hook`, and `Group`. `import` makes another module available under its name, here `Builtins`.

Keep both package URLs on the same version. Changing the hk executable does not rewrite pinned imports in `hk.pkl`.

## Values and local variables

```pkl
local label = "lint"
local workers = 4
local enabled = true
local extensions = List("*.js", "*.ts")
```

Use `local` for helper values that are not part of hk’s schema. Without it, Pkl treats the value as a configuration property.

Strings use double quotes, booleans use `true` and `false`, and a list uses `List(...)`.

## Define a step

```pkl
local eslint = new Step {
  glob = List("*.js", "*.ts")
  check = "eslint {{files}}"
  fix = "eslint --fix {{files}}"
}
```

`new Step` creates an instance of the schema’s step class. `{{files}}` is an hk command template, expanded later when the step runs; it is not Pkl interpolation.

## Reuse steps in mappings

Hooks and steps are mappings keyed by name. Prefer top-level `steps` for linters shared by `check`, `fix`, and `pre-commit`:

```pkl
steps {
  ["eslint"] = Builtins.eslint
  ["prettier"] = Builtins.prettier
}
```

A mapping entry uses `["name"] = value`. Each name must be unique within the mapping.

Top-level `steps` is optional. To share a mapping between selected explicit hooks instead, use a local helper:

```pkl
local linters = new Mapping<String, Step> {
  ["eslint"] = Builtins.eslint
  ["prettier"] = Builtins.prettier
}

hooks {
  ["check"] { steps = linters }
  ["fix"] {
    fix = true
    steps = new Mapping<String, Step> {
      ...linters
      ["shellcheck"] = Builtins.shellcheck
    }
  }
}
```

## Amend a builtin

Parentheses followed by an object body create a modified copy:

```pkl
steps {
  ["prettier"] = (Builtins.prettier) {
    glob = List("*.js", "*.ts")
    exclude = List("**/generated/**")
  }
}
```

Unspecified properties keep the builtin’s values. Assigning a new list replaces that property’s list; it does not automatically append to it.

## Use raw strings for commands

Raw strings help when a command contains quotes or backslashes:

```pkl
local json_check = new Step {
  glob = "*.json"
  check = #"jq -e '.' {{files}} >/dev/null"#
}
```

For longer commands, use a multiline raw string:

```pkl
local test = new Step {
  check = #"""
    echo "Running tests"
    mise run test
    """#
}
```

The closing delimiter determines indentation. Keep the body indented consistently.

## Comments

```pkl
// A comment
/* A multiline comment */
/// A documentation comment
local explanation = "Documentation comments describe the following declaration."
```

## Share configuration across files

```pkl
amends "./hk.pkl"

hooks {
  ["check"] {
    steps {
      ["local-check"] {
        check = "make local-check"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is a local amendment of an existing project configuration. Save it as `hk.local.pkl` and keep it out of version control. The selected file amends `hk.pkl`; hk does not independently merge those two project files. See [local overrides](/configuration#hk-local-pkl).

## Validate and inspect

```sh
hk validate
hk check --plan
```

Validation evaluates the configuration without executing linter commands. A plan then shows how hk selects steps and files.

If the Pkl CLI is installed, inspect the evaluated module with:

```sh
pkl eval --format json hk.pkl
```

Use the [Pkl language reference](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html) for features beyond these examples.

## Evaluators

hk includes [pklr](https://github.com/jdx/pklr) and always uses it to evaluate project, local, and global configuration. The standalone Pkl CLI remains useful for inspecting modules, but it is not an hk runtime dependency or fallback evaluator.

## Caching

The built-in evaluator persists downloaded packages and seeds the cache with the Pkl package matching the running hk version. Use [`HK_PKL_OFFLINE`](/environment_variables#hk-pkl-offline) to require cached or embedded packages without network access.

Release builds cache evaluated configuration; debug builds disable this cache by default. When diagnosing an unexpected result after changing an import or evaluation input, bypass or clear the cache:

```sh
HK_CACHE=0 hk validate
hk cache clear
```

Use hk’s runtime settings, profiles, and command environment where possible instead of making configuration depend on changing evaluation inputs.
